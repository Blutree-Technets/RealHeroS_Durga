                    'Welcome to the RealHeroS mobile application or website, operated by BluTree Technology Networks in association with an all India NGO called Durga India whose aim is to deter sexual harassment.!'
                    'Durga India’s (“we”, “our”, or “us”) vision is to ensure safety for all against sexual harassment and a mission of orchestrating the role of all four players: men, women, communities and spaces in women’s safety. We believe that womanhood is to be loved, not feared. At Durga, we speak about everyday struggles that are silenced of dismissed and spell out what is silently conveyed.'
                    'Our mission is to build safe, inclusive public spaces by transforming the culture that perpetuates discrimination and violence. We intend on giving the power back to the citizens. We carry out this mission by building the power of people to create measurable and long-lasting impacts in the movement for public justice. The Services also permit users to learn about Durga India’s programs; view information about harassment, educational materials, videos, and news; and make donations.'
