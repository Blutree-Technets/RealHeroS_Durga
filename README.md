# Introduction:
The basic concept of our solution is that citizens depend on each other instead of government authorities in times of distress.

# Our Solution:
1. The device is essentially an easily concealable button triggered device which calls for immediate help 
   while also alerting people nearby (Active Bystanders) and other users of our application that the user 
   is in need of help.
2. Our device helps users inform their personal emergency contacts on our app that they are in danger 
   with the live location.
3. The device also has a mobile application that has nearby police station and hospital contact details on 
   standby, The app can work independently too.
4. We have partnered with Durga India and are being incubated as one of their Voice Labs. This is 
   extremely useful in order to have a reliable network of Durgas and Safe Zones.
5. It comprises of Safe Zones which are public locations like shops, banks etc where trained Durga 
   volunteers will be present at all times.
6. We have been guided and sensitized towards this topic by Durga India
