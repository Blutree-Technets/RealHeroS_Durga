# RealHeros-Durga

The basic concept is that citizens depend on each other along with government authorities in times of distress.
So, therefore, we a college StartUp, Blutree Technology Networks along with Durga(NGO. working for women's safety for over 10 years) bring in a Standalone App for the safety of women.

# Our Solution:
   1. The device is essentially an easily concealable button triggered device which calls for immediate help 
      while also alerting people nearby (Active Bystanders) and other users of our application that the user 
      is in need of help.
   2. Our device helps users inform their personal emergency contacts on our app that they are in danger 
      with the live location.
   3. The device also has a mobile application that has nearby police station and hospital contact details on 
      standby, The app can work independently too.
   4. We have partnered with Durga India and are being incubated as one of their Voice Labs. This is 
      extremely useful in order to have a reliable network of Durgas and Safe Zones.
   5. It comprises of Safe Zones which are public locations like shops, banks etc where trained Durga 
      volunteers will be present at all times.
   6. We have been guided and sensitized towards this topic by Durga India
